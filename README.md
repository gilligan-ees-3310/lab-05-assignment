## The Assignment:

There are two files for this lab.

1. Start by reading [`lab-05-instructions.pdf`](lab-05-instructions.pdf), 
   (online version [`lab-05-instructions.md`](lab-05-instructions.md) on 
   GitHub) which gives the exercises you need to do for this lab, broken down
   step by step.

2. When you come to lab, you will work through the exercises, and you will
   edit the file `lab-05-report.Rmd` to write your answers and show your
   work.

   Just as you did for the last lab, as you work through the exercises for this 
   lab, I want you to think about how you integrate your text and code, so you 
   describe what you are going to do with your data, then have a chunk of R code 
   that does what you just described, and is followed by more text that 
   discusses the results or the next steps, depending on where you are in the 
   process.

## Instructions:

* Accept this assignment.
* Clone a local copy of the file repository from GitHub to your
  own computer.
* In your local repository, answer the exercises in the template
  `lab-05-report.Rmd`.
* When you are done, knit your `.Rmd` files into PDF files.
* Use git to commit your changes (including the edits to the `.Rmd` files
  and the new PDF files) to your local git repository.
* Push the changes from your local git repository to GitHub.

  The last changes that you push before the due date
  (9:00 AM Wednesday March 2) will be graded. If you run into 
  difficulty and need extra time, please contact Mr. de Wet or Prof. Gilligan.

I advise using git to commit changes frequently as you work and push those 
commits to GitHub.

I also advise knitting your answers frequently to make sure that they
knit correctly.
