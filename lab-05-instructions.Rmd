# Exercises with clouds and feedbacks

# Exercises

These are the exercises you will work for the lab this week.

## General Instructions

For this week's lab, when you write up the answers, I would
like you to think about integrating your R code chunks with your text.

For instance, you can describe what you're going to do to answer the question, 
and then for each step, after you describe what you're going to do in that
step, you can include an R code chunk to do what you just described, and then
the subsequent text can either discuss the results of what you just did
or describe what the next step of the analysis will do.

This way, your answer can have several small chunks of R code that build on
each other and follow the flow of your text.

## Exercise 1: Clouds and Infrared.

**Note:** this exercise only considers the effect of clouds on longwave
radiation and ignores the effect of clouds on albedo, which is also important.

a) Run the MODTRAN model with the default conditions: 
   present-day CO~2~ (400 ppm), a tropical atmosphere, and the sensor looking 
   down from an altitude of 70 km.
   Plot the outgoing infrared spectrum. 
   
   Run MODTRAN four times: first with no clouds, and then with three different
   kinds of clouds: standard cirrus, altostratus, and stratus
   (`clouds = "standard cirrus"`, `clouds = "altostratus"`, and 
   `clouds = "stratus"`). These correspond to clouds at high, medium, and low
   altitude, respectively.

   Describe the important differences between the spectra for the four cases.
   Describe the differences in the intensity of outgoing infrared radiation
   $I_{\text{out}}$ for the four cases.

   How do the four spectra compare for the band of wavenumbers from about 
   600--750 cm^-1^ (where CO~2~ absorbs strongly) and the band from about 
   800--1200 cm^-1^ (the atmospheric window)?

   Which kind of cloud has the greatest impact on outgoing infrared light?
   Why?

b) Keeping the default settings (sensor altitude = 70 km looking down), 
   Set `atmosphere = "midlatitude winter"` and `h2o_scale=1` and 
   run MODTRAN with no clouds.

   Next, run MODTRAN with the same settings, but with `altitude_km = 0` and 
   `looking="up"`.
   This means your sensor is on the ground looking up at the longwave radiation 
   coming down from the atmosphere to the ground instead of looking down from 
   the top of the atmosphere at the longwave radiation going out to space.
   
   Plot the two spectra (looking down from 70 km and looking up from the ground)
   and describe what you see. 
   Pay special attention to the parts of the spectrum corresponding to the 
   strong CO~2~ absorption (roughly 600--750 cm^-1^) and the infrared window 
   (roughly 800--1200 cm^-1^). 

   Which parts of the spectrum correspond to warmer temperatures
   temperatures when you look down, and which parts correspond to colder 
   temperatures?
   What about when you are looking up from the ground?
   Do you notice a pattern?
   
c) Now, run MODTRAN with the sensor looking up from the ground
   (`altitude = 0` and `looking = "up"`), but with stratus clouds 
   (`clouds = "stratus"`).

   When we're looking up at the clouds, the base (bottom) of the clouds form
   a layer that is opaque to longwave radiation, with an emissivity of 1
   (i.e., a perfect black body).

   Make a note of 
   _I_~down~ for the clear sky and with clouds. 
   (Remember that the variable `i_out` in the MODTRAN output measures the 
   intensity of longwave radiation reaching the sensor.
   In this exercise, the sensor is on the ground looking up, so `i_out` 
   measures the downward radiation reaching the ground.)

   Plot the spectra for both cases and also compare _I_~down~.

   * What part of the spectrum is most affected by clouds? 
     (Answer both in terms of what ranges of wavelengths or wavenumbers are
     affected, and also what name we give to this part of the spectrum).
   * On a winter night in Nashville, would it be colder if the sky is clear or
     if it's cloudy?

d) Now set `clouds` to `"none"`,
   and keep the sensor altitude at 0 km (`altitude_km = 0`) 
   looking up (`looking = "up"`). 
   
   Run MODTRAN first with `h2o_scale = 1` (the default), and then with
   `h2o_scale = 0` (no water vapor).
    
   Plot the two spectra (with water vapor and without water vapor) and compare 
   them. 
   Discuss why you see what you see:
    
   * For the atmosphere with no water vapor, compare the parts of the 
     spectrum corresponding to the strong CO~2~ absorption 
     (roughly 600--750 cm^-1^) and the infrared window 
     (roughly 800--1200 cm^-1^). 

     * Which parts of the spectrum correspond to higher emission temperatures 
       and which to lower temperatures? 
     * Why do you think this is?
    
   * For the atmosphere with normal water vapor (`h2o_scale = 1`), how does 
     water vapor change the spectrum you see from the ground?

     * Does it make the longwave radiation brighter (warmer) or dimmer
       (cooler)?
       * Why do you think this is?

## Exercise 2: Water Vapor Feedback

For this exercise, you will use the RRTM model to examine climate sensitivity
and the water vapor feedback in a radiative-convective atmosphere.

a) First, run the RRTM model with its default parameters (400 ppm CO~2~) and 
   note the surface temperature (`T_surface`).
   
   Then run it again with doubled CO~2~ concentration (`co2 = 800`).
   Adjust the surface temperature to bring the heat imbalance `Q` to zero
   (it may be easier to do this with the interactive model at 
   <http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/rrtm/> and then paste the new surface
   temperature into your R code).
    
   The change in surface temperature between the 400 ppm CO~2~ and 
   800 ppm CO~2~ ($\Delta T_{2 \times \text{CO}_2}$) runs is the 
   **climate sensitivity**. What is it?

b) Now run the RRTM model again, with 400 ppm CO~2~, but this time 
   setting `relative_humidity = 0` (this turns off the water vapor feedback).
   Adjust  `T_surface` to bring the heat into balance (so the output has `Q` 
   equal to zero). Note the value of `T_surface`.
   
   Now double the CO~2~ concentration (to 800 ppm) and adjust `T_surface` to
   bring the heat into balance. 
   What is the climate sensitivity $\Delta T_{2 \times \text{CO}_2}$
   when there is no water-vapor feedback?
   
c) Compare the climate sensitivity ($\Delta T_{2 \times \text{CO}_2}$) in 
   part (a) (with water-vapor feedback) and part (b) (without water-vapor 
   feedback).
   The amplification factor for the water-vapor feedback is the ratio of the 
   climate sensitivity with water-vapor feedback to the sensitivity without the 
   feedback. 
   What is the amplification factor?

In your write-up, discuss how including the water vapor feedback changes the 
way that CO~2~ affects the climate.
